### Hi there 👋 I'm Dominik

**Front-End Developer 💻 | Future Pilot ✈️ | Certified IT Technician 🛠️**

Welcome to my GitHub! I like to keep things flying smoothly—whether that's a modern web application or an actual aircraft. 

Currently a 3rd-year **Aviation (Pilotage)** student, I combine my passion for aviation with a solid commercial background in web development. I spend my days learning how to navigate the skies and my nights building front-end architectures. 

#### 🚀 What I'm up to:
* 💼 **Working commercially:** Developing and administrating commercial websites using **WordPress, WooCommerce, and Elementor** (check out sentimenti.pl or caridentdental.pl).
* 💻 **Coding for fun & future:** Building fast, scalable web applications in my free time using **Next.js** and **React**. 
* ✈️ **Flying:** Logging flight hours, studying aerodynamics, and mastering complex aeronautical procedures.

#### 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools:
* **Core:** JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
* **Frameworks & Libraries:** Next.js, React
* **CMS & E-commerce:** WordPress, WooCommerce, Elementor
* **Workflow:** Git, GitHub, VS Code

#### 🛫 Why a pilot makes a great developer:
Writing clean code is a lot like flying an airplane. Both require **rigorous analytical thinking**, a proactive approach to **troubleshooting**, and the ability to **stay calm and solve problems under pressure**. Whether I'm debugging a tricky Next.js component or executing a pre-flight checklist, precision is everything.
